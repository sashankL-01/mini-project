# Unveiling the Journey to Success: A Data-Driven Tale of Placements

## Project Overview
This project is a class project for the course **Data Analysis and Visualization** at **IIT Bhilai**. It explores a placement dataset to uncover the factors that influence job placements among students. The analysis combines data cleaning, exploration, and modeling to provide actionable insights for students preparing for placements. Additionally, a website is created to present the findings in an engaging and accessible format.

## Data Analysis

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle and contains information about students and their placement outcomes.

### Steps Performed
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed rows with missing values.
   - Deleted the unnecessary `studentid` column.
   - Removed duplicate records.
   - Combined internships, projects, and certifications into a single measure called the "Experience Score."

2. **Data Exploration**:
   - Analyzed the impact of CGPA, internships, projects, and soft skills on placement outcomes.
   - Visualized patterns and trends using plots and charts.

3. **Key Insights**:
   - Students with higher experience scores had better placement rates.
   - CGPA is important but not the sole determinant of success.
   - Internships and soft skills significantly influence employability.

4. **Data Modeling**:
   - Used predictive modeling to estimate placement outcomes based on various factors.
